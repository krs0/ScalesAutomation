General workings

- Capture all bytes sent by the scale
- Based on Start char 24H group into valid measurements
- Transform weight into integer values
- Apply ZeroThreshold
- Between 2 zero's record only LAST STABLE! measurement (the time a measurement has to be stable is a setting of the App) (Record = Add valid measurement to GUI and Excel)
- When Lot ends copy Excel to network shared folder and make local backup copy

When same lot number is chosen, the measurements are appended to existing file.
